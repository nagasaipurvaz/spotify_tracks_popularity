Objective:

The goal was to predict the popularity of songs based on various audio and metadata features using machine learning models and determine which model is better fit and predict if our song will go viral on spotify using better fit model

INTRODUCTION:

In today's music industry, understanding what makes a song popular is crucial for artists, producers, and streaming platforms. With millions of songs available on platforms like Spotify, predicting a song's potential popularity can provide valuable insights for decision-making and audience engagement.

This project aims to predict the popularity of songs based on various audio features (such as loudness, danceability, and energy) and metadata features (like release year and language) using machine learning models. The objective is twofold:

Evaluate and compare different machine learning models to determine which is best suited for predicting song popularity.
Use the best-fit model to create a practical tool that predicts whether a specific song will gain popularity on Spotify based on its features.
This project provides a data-driven approach to assess a song's potential to go viral, helping stakeholders in the music industry make informed decisions.

ABSTRACT:

This project applies machine learning for the prediction of song popularity on Spotify, considering both audio and metadata features. The major objectives include finding the most influential features of popularity in a song, comparing different machine learning models, and considering the best-fitted model for the prediction of new song success.

The feature importance analysis showed that year, loudness, energy, and danceability were the main attributes for popularity. Random Forest was picked as the best model since it had the capability to handle non-linear relationships and also resists irrelevant features. A user-friendly function was executed to predict a song's popularity in percentage form according to characteristics.

CONCLUSION: 

The project serves as a practical application of machine learning in the music industry and will shed light on important insights for artists, producers, and streaming platforms in order to predict audience preferences and create optimized content. Future Work: Incorporate other feature variables like genre and social media activity for better prediction accuracy, with a view to incorporating time-series analysis for forecasting trends.

This project successfully applied machine learning techniques to predict the popularity of songs on Spotify based on audio and metadata features. Using models such as Random Forest, we were able to identify the most influential features that contribute to a song's popularity, including year, loudness, energy, and danceability. These insights provide a data-driven understanding of audience preferences and music trends.

Among them, the Random Forest model showed the best performance due to its ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships and robustness against features that are irrelevant. We used this model to develop a practical tool that predicts the popularity of a song as a percentage based on its characteristics-a tool of great value for artists, producers, and streaming platforms.

However, the model is highly dependent on the quality and variability of the dataset, and some external factors such as marketing efforts and cultural trends were not taken into consideration. Further development may include additional features like genre or social media activity and time-series analysis to capture evolving trends.

Overall, this project highlights the potential of machine learning to optimize decision-making in the music industry, offering a powerful tool for assessing and predicting song popularity.
